<p><span class="smcap">My</span> first thought was to print these reminiscences
in a newspaper. But our papers are unable to pay
for contributions. It was not so in the former days.
Well do I remember when the <i>Dispatch</i> cheerfully
gave me its dollars, not merely for stories and
sketches, but for trifles like the &#8220;<i>Weekly Rekord
uv amewsments</i>,&#8221; which I then kept, and which
seemed to please our good people of Richmond, who
were then doing so well in business that they were
easily pleased. And truly in those times they were
a liberal, open-hearted set. So would they be now
were they able.</p>

<p>Will we ever see good times and plenty of money
again? I think so. And yet often I get very blue,
apprehending still greater business troubles, culminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in I know not what of civil disaster. It is
touching to me, going around, as I have had to do a
great deal of late, among our business men, to see
their sad faces, and yet their evident anxiety in the
midst of worries and cares, to help one who is even
worse off than themselves. We have good stock
here&mdash;men who would honor any city in the land,
and who make up a community in which it is a
pleasure to live. Here and there you find one, two,
or three close-fisted fellows, who dodge you for fear
you will ask them for something. That is to their
credit, for it shows that they have feeling and a sense
of shame. And again you meet positive brutes, who
are not merely stingy and mean, but ill-mannered
and under-bred to boot. But these serve as foils to
set off their better brethren to more advantage; and
I, for one, am not the man to abuse stingy people.
They have one magnificent trait to counterpoise
their littleness&mdash;they pay their debts, and pay them
promptly. So, take it all in all, Richmond is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as good a place to live in as a man will find on this
globe, as I have learned by playing book-canvasser,&mdash;an
excellent school for the study of men.</p>

<p>But shall we see better times? Why, yes, surely.
They have begun already in Troy, N. Y., the papers
say. And I verily believe the railway, which is to
take the place of the canal, will do more than all
things else to bring back work for all and money
for all of us in our fair city of Richmond. Let us
at least hope so. And with that hope in view, I
trust that these reminiscences of an obsolescent mode
of travel&mdash;which may have been delightful, but certainly
was not rapid&mdash;will give a few moments of
pleasure to the friends of the publishers and of the
writer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Canal Reminiscences.</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">AMONG my earliest recollections is a trip from
Cumberland County to Lynchburg, in 1835, or
thereabouts. As the stage approached Glover&#8217;s
tavern in Appomattox county, sounds as of a cannonade
aroused my childish curiosity to a high pitch.
I had been reading Parley&#8217;s History of America, and
this must be the noise of actual battle. Yes; the war
against the hateful Britishers must have broken out
again. Would the stage carry us within range of the
cannon balls? Yes, and presently the red-coats would
come swarming out of the woods. And&mdash;and&mdash;Gen.
Washington was dead; I was certain of that; what
would become of us? I was terribly excited, but
afraid to ask questions. Perhaps I was scared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Would they kill an unarmed boy, sitting peaceably
in a stage coach? Of course they would; Britishers
will do anything! Then they will have to shoot a
couple of men first;&mdash;and I squeezed still closer between
them.</p>

<p>My relief and my disappointment were equally
great, when a casual remark unfolded the fact that the
noise which so excited me was only the &#8220;blasting of
rock on the Jeems and Kanawha Canell.&#8221; What was
&#8220;blasting of rock?&#8221;</p>

<p>What was a &#8220;canell?&#8221; and, above all, what manner
of thing was a &#8220;Jeems and Kanawha Canell?&#8221;
Was it alive?</p>

<p>I think it was; more alive than it has ever been
since, except for the first few years after it was opened.</p>

<p>Those were the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of batteaux,&mdash;picturesque
craft that charmed my young eyes more
than all the gondolas of Venice would do now. True,
they consumed a week in getting from Lynchburg to
Richmond, and ten days in returning against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
stream, but what of that? Time was abundant in those
days. It was made for slaves, and we had the slaves. A
batteau on the water was more than a match for the
best four or six horse bell-team that ever rolled over
the red clay of Bedford, brindle dog and tar-bucket
included.</p>

<p>Fleets of these batteaux used to be moored on the
river bank near where the depot of the Virginia and
Tennessee Railroad now stands; and many years after
the &#8220;Jeems and Kanawha&#8221; was finished, one of them
used to haunt the mouth of Blackwater creek above
the toll-bridge, a relic of departed glory. For if
ever man gloried in his calling,&mdash;the negro batteau-man
was that man. His was a hardy calling, demanding
skill, courage and strength in a high degree.
I can see him now striding the plank that ran along
the gunwale to afford him footing, his long iron-shod
pole trailing in the water behind him. Now he turns,
and after one or two ineffectual efforts to get his pole
fixed in the rocky bottom of the river, secures his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
purchase, adjusts the upper part of the pole to the pad
at his shoulder, bends to his task, and the long,
but not ungraceful bark mounts the rapids like
a sea-bird breasting the storm. His companion
on the other side plies the pole with equal ardor,
and between the two the boat bravely surmounts every
obstacle, be it rocks, rapids, quicksands, hammocks,
what not. A third negro at the stern held the
mighty oar that served as a rudder. A stalwart,
jolly, courageous set they were, plying the pole all
day, hauling in to shore at night under the friendly
shade of a mighty sycamore, to rest, to eat, to play
the banjo, and to snatch a few hours of profound,
blissful sleep.</p>

<p>The up-cargo, consisting of sacks of salt, bags of
coffee, barrels of sugar, molasses and whiskey, afforded
good pickings. These sturdy fellows lived
well, I promise you, and if they stole a little, why,
what was their petty thieving compared to the enormous
pillage of the modern sugar refiner and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
crooked-whiskey distiller? They lived well. Their
cook&#8217;s galley was a little dirt thrown between the
ribs of the boat at the stern, with an awning on occasion
to keep off the rain, and what they didn&#8217;t eat
wasn&#8217;t worth eating. Fish of the very best, both
salt and fresh, chickens, eggs, milk and the invincible,
never-satisfying ash-cake and fried bacon. I see
the frying-pan, I smell the meat, the fish, the Rio
coffee!&mdash;I want the batteau back again, aye! and the
brave, light-hearted slave to boot. What did he
know about the State debt? There was no State
debt to speak of. Greenbacks? Bless, you! the
Farmers Bank of Virginia was living and breathing,
and its money was good enough for a king. Readjustment,
funding bill, tax-receivable coupons&mdash;where
were all these worries then? I think if we
had known they were coming, we would have stuck
to the batteaux and never dammed the river. Why,
shad used to run to Lynchburg! The world was
merry, butter-milk was abundant; Lynchburg a lad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Richmond a mere youth, and the great &#8220;Jeems and
Kanawha canell&#8221; was going to&mdash;oh! it was going to
do everything.</p>

<p>This was forty years ago and more, mark you.</p>

<p>In 1838, I made my first trip to Richmond.
What visions of grandeur filled my youthful imagination!
That eventually I should get to be a man
seemed probable, but that I should ever be big
enough to live, actually live, in the vast metropolis,
was beyond my dreams. For I believed fully that
men were proportioned to the size of the cities they
lived in. I had seen a man named Hatcher from
Cartersville, who was near about the size of the average
man in Lynchburg, but as I had never seen Cartersville,
I concluded, naturally enough, that Cartersville
must be equal in population. Which may be the
fact, for I have never yet seen Cartersville, though I
have been to Warminster, and once came near passing
through Bent-Creek.</p>

<p>I went by stage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>It took two days to make the trip, yet no one complained,
although there were many Methodist ministers
aboard. Bro. Lafferty had not been born. I
thought it simply glorious. There was an unnatural
preponderance of preacher to boy,&mdash;nine of
preacher to one of boy. That boy did not take a
leading part in the conversation. He looked out of
the window, and thought much about Richmond.
And what a wonderful world it was! So many trees,
such nice rocks, and pretty ruts in the red clay; such
glorious taverns, and men with red noses; such
splendid horses, a fresh team every ten miles, and
an elegant smell of leather, proceeding from the coach,
prevailing everywhere as we bowled merrily along.
And then the stage horn. Let me not speak of it,
lest Thomas and his orchestra hang their heads for
very shame. I wish somebody would tell me where
we stopped the first night, for I have quite forgotten.
Any how, it was on the left-hand side coming down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and I rather think on the brow of a little hill. I
know we got up mighty soon the next morning.</p>

<p>We drew up at the Eagle hotel in Richmond.
Here again words, and time too, fail me. All the
cities on earth packed into one wouldn&#8217;t look as big
and fine to me now as Main street did then. If
things shrink so in the brief space of a life-time,
what would be the general appearance, say of Petersburg,
if one should live a million or so of years? This
is an interesting question, which you may discuss
with yourself, dear reader.</p>

<p>Going northward, I remained a year or two, and
on my return the &#8220;canell&#8221; was finished. I had seen
bigger places than Richmond, but had yet to have
my first experience of canal travelling. The packet-landing
at the foot of Eighth street presented a scene
of great activity. Passengers on foot and in vehicles
continued to arrive up to the moment of starting. I
took a peep at the cabin, wondering much how all
the passengers were to be accommodated for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
night, saw how nicely the baggage was stored away on
deck, admired the smart waiters, and picked up a deal
of information generally. I became acquainted with
the names of Edmond &amp; Davenport in Richmond,
and Boyd, Edmond &amp; Davenport in Lynchburg, the
owners of the packet-line, and thought to myself,
&#8220;What immensely rich men they must be! Why,
these boats cost ten times as much as a stage-coach,
and I am told they have them by the dozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last we were off, slowly pushed along under
the bridge on Seventh street; then the horses were
hitched; then slowly along till we passed the crowd
of boats near the city, until at length, with a lively
jerk as the horses fell into a trot, away we went, the
cut-water throwing up the spray as we rounded the
Penitentiary hill, and the passengers lingering on
deck to get a last look at the fair city of Richmond,
lighted by the pale rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>As the shadows deepened, everybody went below.
There was always a crowd in those days, but it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
crowd for the most part of our best people, and no
one minded it. I was little, and it took little room
to accommodate me. Everything seemed as cozy
and comfortable as heart could wish. I brought to
the table,&mdash;an excellent one it was,&mdash;a school boy&#8217;s appetite,
sharpened by travel, and thought it was &#8220;just
splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Supper over, the men went on deck to smoke,
while the ladies busied themselves with draughts or
backgammon, with conversation or with books. But
not for long. The curtains which separated the
female from the male department were soon drawn,
in order that the steward and his aids might make
ready the berths. These were three deep, &#8220;lower,&#8221;
&#8220;middle&#8221; and &#8220;upper;&#8221; and great was the desire on
the part of the men not to be consigned to the
&#8220;upper.&#8221; Being light as a cork, I rose naturally to
the top, clambering thither by the leathern straps with
the agility of a monkey, and enjoying as best I might
the trampling overhead whenever we approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a lock. I didn&#8217;t mind this much, but when the fellow
who had snubbed the boat jumped down about
four feet, right on my head as it were, it was pretty
severe. Still I slept the sleep of youth. We all
went to bed early. A few lingered, talking in low
tones; and way-passengers, in case there was a crowd,
were dumped upon mattresses, placed on the dining
tables.</p>

<p>The lamp shed a dim light over the sleepers, and
all went well till some one&mdash;and there always was
some one&mdash;began to snore. <i>Sn-a-a-aw!</i>&mdash;<i>aw-aw-poof!</i>
They would turn uneasily and try to compose themselves
to slumber again. No use. <i>Sn-a-a-aw</i>&mdash;<i>poof!</i>
&#8220;D&mdash;&mdash; that fellow! Chunk him in the
ribs, somebody, and make him turn over. Is this
thing to go on forever? Gentlemen, are you going
to stand this all night? If you are, I am not. I
am going to get up and dress. Who is he anyhow?
No gentleman would or could snore in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while silence would be restored, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
would drop off to sleep again, except the little fellow
in the upper berth, who lying there would listen to
the <i>trahn-ahn-ahn-ahn</i> of the packet-horn as we
drew nigh the locks. How mournfully it sounded
in the night! what a doleful thing it is at best, and
how different from the stage-horn with its cheery,
ringing notes! The difference in the horns marks
the difference in the two eras of travel; not that the
canal period is doleful&mdash;I would not say that, but it
is less bright than the period of the stage-coach.</p>

<p>To this day you have only to say within my hearing
<i>trahn-ahn-ahn</i>, to bring back the canal epoch. I
can see the whole thing down to the snubbing post
with its deep grooves which the heavy rope had
worn. Indeed, I think I could snub a boat myself
with very little practice, if the man on deck would
say &#8220;<i>hup!</i>&#8221; to the horses at the proper time.</p>

<p>We turned out early in the morning, and had precious
little room for dressing. But that was no hardship
to me, who had just emerged from a big boarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
school dormitory. Still, I must say, being now a
grown and oldish man, that I would not like to live
and sleep and dress for twenty or thirty years in the
cabin of a canal-packet. The ceremony of ablution
was performed in a primitive fashion. There were
the tin basins, the big tin dipper with the long wooden
handle. I feel it vibrating in the water now, and
the water a little muddy generally; and there were
the towels, a big one on a roller, and the little ones
in a pile, and all of them wet. These were discomforts,
it is true, but, pshaw! one good, big, long, deep
draught of pure, fresh morning air&mdash;one glimpse of
the roseate flush above the wooded hills of the James,
one look at the dew besprent bushes and vines along
the canal bank&mdash;one sweet caress of dear mother
nature in her morning robes, made ample compensation
for them all. Breakfast was soon served, and
all the more enjoyed in consequence of an hour&#8217;s fasting
on deck; the sun came out in all his splendor;
the day was fairly set in, and with it there was abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
leisure to enjoy the scenery, that grew more and
more captivating as we rose, lock after lock, into the
rock-bound eminences of the upper James. This
scenery I will not attempt to describe, for time has
sadly, dimmed it in my recollection. The wealth of
the lowlands, and the upland beauty must be seen as
I have seen them, in the day of their prime, to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>The perfect cultivation, the abundance, the elegance,
the ducal splendor, one might almost say, of the great
estates that lay along the canal in the old days have
passed away in a great measure. Here were gentlemen,
not merely refined and educated, fitted to display
a royal hospitality and to devote their leisure
to the study of the art and practice of government,
but they were great and greatly successful farmers
as well. The land teemed with all manner of products,
cereals, fruits, what not! negroes by the hundreds
and the thousands, under wise direction, gentle
but firm control, plied the hoe to good purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
There was enough and to spare for all&mdash;to spare?
aye! to bestow with glad and lavish hospitality. A
mighty change has been wrought. What that change
is in all of its effects mine eyes have happily been
spared the seeing; but well I remember&mdash;I can never
forget&mdash;how from time to time the boat would stop
at one of these estates, and the planter, his wife, his
daughters, and the guests that were going home with
him, would be met by those who had remained behind,
and how joyous the greetings were! It was a
bright and happy scene, and it continually repeated
itself as we went onward.</p>

<p>In fine summer weather, the passengers, male and
female, stayed most of the time on deck, where there
was a great deal to interest, and naught to mar
the happiness, except the oft-repeated warning,
&#8220;<i>braidge!</i>&#8221; &#8220;<i>low braidge!</i>&#8221; No well-regulated
packet-hand was ever allowed to say plain &#8220;bridge;&#8221;
that was an etymological crime in canal ethics. For
the men, this on-deck existence was especially delightful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it is <i>such</i> a comfort to spit plump into the
water without the trouble of feeling around with
your head, in the midst of a political discussion, for
the spittoon.</p>

<p>As for me, I often went below, to devour Dickens&#8217;s
earlier novels, which were then appearing in rapid
succession. But, drawn by the charm of the scenery,
I would often drop my book and go back on deck
again. There was an islet in the river&mdash;where, exactly,
I cannot tell&mdash;which had a beauty of its own
for me, because from the moment I first saw it, my
purpose was to make it the scene of a romance, when
I got to be a great big man, old enough to write
for the papers. There is a point at which the passengers
would get off, and taking a near cut across
the hills, would stretch their legs with a mile or two
of walking. It was unmanly, I held, to miss that.
Apropos of scenery, I must not forget the haunted
house near Manchester, which was pointed out soon
after we left Richmond, and filled me with awe; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
though I said I did not believe in ghosts, I did. The
ruined mill, a mile or two further on, was always an
object of melancholy interest to me; and of all the
locks from Lynchburg down, the Three-Mile Locks
pleased me most. It is a pretty place, as every one
will own on seeing it. It was so clean and green,
and white and thrifty-looking. To me it was simply
beautiful. I wanted to live there; I ought to have
lived there. I was built for a lock-keeper&mdash;have that
exact moral and mental shape. Ah! to own your
own negro, who would do all the drudgery of opening
the gates. Occasionally you would go through
the form of putting your shoulder to the huge
wooden levers, if that is what they call them, by
which the gates are opened; to own your own negro
and live and die calmly at a lock! What more
could the soul ask? I do think that the finest picture
extant of peace and contentment&mdash;a little abnormal,
perhaps, in the position of the animal&mdash;is
that of a sick mule looking out of the window of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
canal freight-boat. And that you could see every day
from the porch of your cottage, if you lived at a
lock, owned your own negro, and there was no
great rush of business on the canal, (and there seldom
was) on the &#8220;Jeems and Kanawhy,&#8221; as old
Capt. Sam Wyatt always called it, leaving out the
word &#8220;canal,&#8221; for that was understood. Yes, one
ought to live as a pure and resigned lock-keeper, if
one would be blest, really blest.</p>

<p>Now that I am on the back track, let me add that,
however bold and picturesque the cliffs and bluffs
near Lynchburg and beyond, there was nothing from
one end the canal to the other to compare with the
first sight of Richmond, when, rounding a corner not
far from Hollywood, it burst full upon the vision, its
capitol, its spires, its happy homes, flushed with the
red glow of evening. And what it looked to be, it
was. Its interior, far from belieing its exterior,
surpassed it. The world over, there is no lovelier
site for a city; and the world over there was no city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that quite equalled it in the charm of its hospitality,
its refinement, its intelligence, its cordial welcome to
strangers. Few of its inhabitants were very rich,
fewer still were very poor. But I must not dwell on
this. Beautiful city! beautiful city! you may grow to
be as populous as London, and sure no one wishes you
greater prosperity than I, but grow as you may, you
can never be happier than you were in the days
whereof I speak. How your picture comes back to
me, softened by time, glorified by all the tender, glowing
tints of memory. Around you now is the added
glory of history, a defence almost unrivalled in the
annals of warfare; but for me there is something
even brighter than historic fame, a hue derived only
from the heaven of memory. In my childhood, when
all things were beautified by the unclouded light of
&#8220;the young soul wandering here in nature,&#8221; I saw
you in your youth, full of hope, full of promise,
full of all those gracious influences which made your
State greatest among all her sisters, and which seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
concentrated in yourself. Be your maturity what it
may, it can never be brighter than this.</p>

<p>To return to the boat. All the scenery in the
world&mdash;rocks that Salvator would love to paint, and
skies that Claude could never limn&mdash;all the facilities
for spitting that earth affords, avail not to keep a
Virginian away from a julep on a hot summer day.
From time to time he would descend from the deck
of the packet and refresh himself. The bar was
small, but vigorous and healthy. I was then in the
lemonade stage of boyhood, and it was not until
many years afterwards that I rose through porterees
and claret-punches to the sublimity of the sherry
cobbler, and discovered that the packet bar supplied
genuine Havana cigars at fourpence-ha&#8217;penny.
Why, eggs were but sixpence a dozen on the canal
bank, and the national debt wouldn&#8217;t have filled a
tea-cup. Internal revenue was unknown; the coupons
receivable for taxes inconceivable, and forcible
readjustment a thing undreamt of in Virginian philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Mr. Mallock&#8217;s pregnant question, &#8220;Is life
worth living?&#8221; was answered very satisfactorily, methought,
as I watched the Virginians at their juleps:
&#8220;Gentlemen, your very good health;&#8221; &#8220;Colonel,
my respects to you;&#8221; &#8220;My regards, Judge. When
shall I see you again at my house? Can&#8217;t you stop
now and stay a little while, if it is only a week or
two?&#8221; &#8220;Sam,&#8221; (to the bar-keeper,) &#8220;duplicate these
drinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>How they smacked their lips; how hot the talk
on politics became; and how pernicious this example
of drinking in public was to the boy who looked on!
Oh! yes; and if you expect your son to go through
life without bad examples set him by his elders in a
thousand ways, you must take him to another sphere.
Still, the fewer bad examples the better, and you, at
least, need not set them.</p>

<p>Travelling always with my father, who was a merchant,
it was natural that I should become acquainted
with merchants. But I remember very few of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Mr. Daniel H. London, who was a character, and
Mr. Fleming James, who often visited his estate in
Roanoke, and was more of a character than London,
I recall quite vividly. I remember, too, Mr. Francis B.
Deane, who was always talking about Mobjack Bay,
and who was yet to build the Langhorne Foundry
in Lynchburg. I thought if I could just see Mobjack
Bay, I would be happy. According to Mr.
Deane, and I agreed with him, there ought by this
time to have been a great city on Mobjack Bay. I
saw Mobjack Bay last summer, and was happy.
Any man who goes to Gloucester will be happy.
More marked than all of these characters was Major
Yancey, of Buckingham, &#8220;the wheel-horse of Democracy,&#8221;
he was called; Tim. Rives, of Prince
George, whose face, some said, resembled the inside
of a gunlock, being the war-horse. Major Y.&#8217;s stout
figure, florid face, and animated, forcible manner,
come back with some distinctness; and there are
other forms, but they are merely outlines barely discernible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
So pass away men who, in their day, were
names and powers&mdash;shadows gone into shadow-land,
leaving but a dim print upon a few brains, which in
time will soon flit away.</p>

<p>Arrived in Lynchburg, the effect of the canal was
soon seen in the array of freight boats, the activity
and bustle at the packet landing. New names and
new faces, from the canal region of New York, most
likely, were seen and heard. I became acquainted
with the family of Capt. Huntley, who commanded
one of the boats, and was for some years quite intimate
with his pretty daughters, Lizzie, Harriet and
Emma. Capt. H. lived on Church street, next door
to the Reformed, or as it was then called, the Radical
Methodist Church, and nearly opposite to Mr.
Peleg Seabury. He was for a time connected in
some way with the Exchange hotel, but removed
with his family to Cincinnati, since when I have
never but once heard of them. Where are they all,
I wonder? Then, there was a Mr. Watson, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lived with Boyd, Edmond &amp; Davenport, married
first a Miss &mdash;&mdash;, and afterwards, Mrs. Christian,
went into the tobacco business in Brooklyn, then
disappeared, leaving no trace, not the slightest. Then
there was a rare fellow, Charles Buckley, who lived
in the same store with Watson, had a fine voice, and
without a particle of religion in the ordinary sense,
loved dearly to sing at revivals. I went with him;
we took back seats, and sang with great fervor.
This was at night. Besides Captain Huntley,
I remember among the captains of a later
date, Captain Jack Yeatman; and at a date
still later his brother, Captain C. E. Yeatman,
both of whom are still living. There was still
another captain whose name was Love&mdash;&mdash; something,
a very handsome man; and these are all.</p>

<p>In 1849, having graduated in Philadelphia, I
made one of my last through-trips on the canal, the
happy owner of a diploma in a green tin case, and
the utterly miserable possessor of a dyspepsia which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
threatened my life. I enjoyed the night on deck,
sick as I was. The owl&#8217;s &#8220;long hoot,&#8221; the &#8220;plaintive
cry of the whippoorwill;&#8221; the melody&mdash;for it is
by association a melody, which the Greeks have but
travestied with their <i>brek-ke-ex</i>, <i>ko-ex</i>&mdash;of the frogs, the
mingled hum of insect life, the &#8220;stilly sound&#8221; of inanimate
nature, the soft respiration of sleeping earth,
and above all, the ineffable glory of the stars. Oh!
heaven of heavens, into which the sick boy, lying
alone on deck, then looked, has thy charm fled,
too, with so many other charms? Have thirty years
of suffering, of thought, of book-reading, brought
only the unconsoling knowledge, that yonder twinkling
sparks of far-off fire are not lamps that light
the portals of the palace of the King and Father, but
suns like our sun, surrounded by earths full of woe
and doubt like our own; and that heaven, if heaven
there be, is not in the sky; not in space, vast as it is;
not in time, endless though it be&mdash;where then?
&#8220;Near thee, in thy heart!&#8221; Who feels this, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
will say this of himself? Away thou gray-haired,
sunken-cheeked sceptic, away! Come back to me,
come back to me, wan youth; there on that deck,
with the treasure of thy faith, thy trust in men, thy
worship of womankind, thy hope, that sickness
could not chill, in the sweet possibilities of life.
Come back to me!&mdash;&#8217;Tis a vain cry. The youth lies
there on the packet&#8217;s deck, looking upward to the
stars, and he will not return.</p>

<p>The trip in 1849 was a dreary one until there came
aboard a dear lady friend of mine who had recently
been married. I had not had a good honest talk
with a girl for eighteen solid&mdash;I think I had better
say long, (we always say long when speaking of the
war)&mdash;&#8220;fo&#8217; long years!&#8221;&mdash;I have heard it a thousand
times&mdash;for eighteen long months, and you may imagine
how I enjoyed the conversation with my friend.
She wasn&#8217;t very pretty, and her husband was a Louisa
man; but her talk, full of good heart and good sense,
put new life into me. One other through trip, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
very last, I made in 1851. On my return in 1853,
I went by rail as far as Farmville, and thence by
stage to Lynchburg; so that, for purposes of through
travel, the canal lasted, one may say, only ten or a
dozen years. And now the canal, after a fair and
costly trial, is to give place to the rail, and I, in common
with the great body of Virginians, am heartily
glad of it. It has served its purpose well enough,
perhaps, for its day and generation. The world has
passed by it, as it has passed by slavery. Henceforth
Virginia must prove her metal in the front of steam,
electricity, and possibly mightier forces still. If she
can&#8217;t hold her own in their presence, she must go
under. I believe she will hold her own; these very
forces will help her. The dream of the great canal
to the Ohio, with its-nine mile tunnel, costing fifty
or more millions, furnished by the general government,
and revolutionizing the commerce of the
United States, much as the discovery of America
and opening of the Suez canal revolutionized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
commerce of the world, must be abandoned along
with other dreams.</p>

<p>One cannot withhold admiration from President
Johnston and other officers of the canal, who made
such a manful struggle to save it. But who can
war against the elements? Nature herself, imitating
man, seems to have taken special delight in kicking
the canal after it was down. So it must go. Well,
let it go. It knew Virginia in her palmiest days
and it crushed the stage coach; isn&#8217;t that glory
enough? I think it is. But I can&#8217;t help feeling
sorry for the bull frogs; there must be a good many
of them between here and Lexington. What will
become of them, I wonder? They will follow their
predecessors, the batteaux; and their pale, green
ghosts, seated on the prows of shadowy barges, will be
heard piping the roundelays of long-departed joys.</p>

<p>Farewell canal, frogs, musk-rats, mules, packet-horns
and all, a long farewell. Welcome the rail
along the winding valleys of the James. Wake up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Fluvanna! Arise, old Buckingham! Exalt thyself,
O Goochland! And thou, O Powhatan, be not
afraid nor shame-faced any longer, but raise thy
Ebenezer freely, for the day of thy redemption is at
hand. Willis J. Dance shall rejoice; yea, Wm. Pope
Dabney shall be exceeding glad. And all hail our
long lost brother! come to these empty, aching, arms,
dear Lynch&#8217;s Ferry!</p>

<p>I have always thought that the unnatural separation
between Lynchburg and Richmond was the
source of all our troubles. In some way, not entirely
clear to me, it brought on the late war, and it will
bring on another, if a reunion between the two cities
does not soon take place. Baltimore, that pretty
and attractive, but meddlesome vixen, is at the bottom
of it all. Richmond will not fear Baltimore
after the rails are laid. Her prosperity will date
anew from the time of her iron wedding with Lynchburg.
We shall see her merchants on our streets
again, and see them often. That will be a better day.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Alas! there are many we shall not see. John
G. Meem, Sam&#8217;l McCorkle, John Robin McDaniel,
John Hollins, Chas. Phelps, Jno. R. D. Payne, Jehu
Williams, Ambrose Rucker, Wilson P. Bryant, (who
died the other day,) and many, many others will not
come to Richmond any more. They are gone. And
if they came, they would not meet the men they used
to meet; very few of them at least. Jacquelin P.
Taylor, John N. Gordon, Thos. R. Price, Lewis D.
Crenshaw, James Dunlop&mdash;why add to the list?
They too are gone.</p>

<p>But the sons of the old-time merchants of Lynchburg
will meet here the sons of the old-time merchants
of Richmond, and the meeting of the two,
the mingling of the waters&mdash;Blackwater creek with Bacon
Quarter branch&mdash;deuce take it! I have gone off
on the water line again&mdash;the admixture, I should say,
of the sills of Campbell with the spikes of Henrico,
the readjustment, so to speak, of the ties (R. R. ties)
that bind us, will more than atone for the obsolete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
canal, and draw us all the closer by reason of our long
separation and estrangement. Richmond and Lynchburg
united will go onward and upward in a common
career of glory and prosperity. And is there, can
there be, a Virginian, deserving the name, who would
envy that glory, or for a moment retard that prosperity?
Not one, I am sure.</p>

<p>Allow me, now that my reminiscences are ended,
allow me, as an old stager and packet-horn reverer,
one last Parthian shot. It is this: If the James river
does not behave better hereafter than it has done of
late, the railroad will have to be suspended in mid-heaven
by means of a series of stationary balloons;
travelling then may be a little wabbly, but at all
events, it won&#8217;t be wet.</p>
